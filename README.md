# DirectServo
Controller that drives BLDC motor as servo


More details to come, 
for now this is just a placeholder informing that this is a motor driver microcontroller board that can be attached to a 3-phase
BLDC motor (such as a camera gimbal) and control it via RS485 protocol. 
It receives torque commands and sends back the angular position read via magnetic sensor.
